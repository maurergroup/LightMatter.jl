    abstract = {The simulation of non-equilibrium electron distributions is essential for capturing light-metal interactions and therefore the study of photoabsorption, photocatalysis, laser ablation, and many other phenomena. Current methodologies, such as the Boltzmann equation using full collision integrals, describe non-equilibrium electron dynamics in great detail but at often prohibitive computational expense. In contrast, the simplification via a relaxation time approach can hinder the description of important features or, even worse, lead to nonphysical behavior due to the lack of particle and energy conservation. We propose a model that bridges the gap between the Boltzmann equation and two-temperature models to trace non-equilibrium distributions efficiently. This Athermal Electron Model (AthEM) separately captures the dynamics of thermal and athermal electrons and describes the energy and particle flow between two electronic systems and phonons. We show that the results align well with the results of Boltzmann equation and data from photoemission experiments. The AthEM enables the rapid generation of qualitatively accurate non-equilibrium electron distributions and provides a good starting point for further extensions.},

    abstract = {The dependence of the strength of the electron-phonon coupling and the electron heat capacity on the electron temperature is investigated for eight representative metals, Al, Cu, Ag, Au, Ni, Pt, W, and Ti, for the conditions of strong electron-phonon nonequilibrium. These conditions are characteristic of metal targets subjected to energetic ion bombardment or short-pulse laser irradiation. Computational analysis based on first-principles electronic structure calculations of the electron density of states predicts large deviations (up to an order of magnitude) from the commonly used approximations of linear temperature dependence of the electron heat capacity and a constant electron-phonon coupling. These thermophysical properties are found to be very sensitive to details of the electronic structure of the material. The strength of the electron-phonon coupling can either increase (Al, Au, Ag, Cu, and W), decrease (Ni and Pt), or exhibit nonmonotonic changes (Ti) with increasing electron temperature. The electron heat capacity can exhibit either positive (Au, Ag, Cu, and W) or negative (Ni and Pt) deviations from the linear temperature dependence. The large variations of the thermophysical properties, revealed in this work for the range of electron temperatures typically realized in femtosecond laser material processing applications, have important implications for quantitative computational analysis of ultrafast processes associated with laser interaction with metals.},
